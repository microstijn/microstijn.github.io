## Introduction

I am a (micro) biologist, programmer and music enthusiast. I have been active as cell biologist investigating the cell biology of Planctomycetes during a PhD at the (environmental) microbiology department \@ [radboud](https://www.ru.nl/microbiology/). 

I love creating, managing, exploring and visualising large datasets with biological meaning, and I am a big believer in europe and european (science) collaboration. I can be contacted for collaborations of any kind. 

## Current projects

### Open for recruitment

Nearing the end of my PhD means I am available for hire!

### Genome architecture of Prokaryotes

Total number of genes and the related concepts coding density and gene density are commonly used to describe a prokaryotic genome, but the underlying genomic architecture that belies a dense or sparsely coded genome is not often discussed past the point of establishing that a genome is or isn’t dense. I have set out to show different strategies in becoming dense in a dataset spanning across all prokaryotyes.

For a blog on the project click [here](/menu1/)

### Convolution / deconvolution

I have used deconvolution software to denoise image datasets, and to increase the spatial resolution of fluorophores. I want to fully understand the inner workings of these usefull techniques, and am implementing a simple version [here](/menu2/).

## Skills

1. Research of biological topics with(in) a team
1. Various types of light microscopy (brigh field, fluorecent, confocal, timelapse, etc)
1. Computational analysis of large sets of images
1. Transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, from sample to figure
1. Coding pipelines that take raw data and produce figures, with minimal user input
1. Cloning in *B. subtilis*, *E. coli* and various Planctomycetes
1. Lab scale bioreactor systems
1. Antibody techniques, precipitation, blotting, etc.
1. R/Julia programming languages
1. Linux/bash
1. LaTeX / html, markdown languages
