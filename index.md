## Introduction

I'm Stijn, biologist and programmer. I have been active as cell biologist investigating the cell biology of Planctomycetes during a PhD at the (environmental) microbiology department \@ [radboud](https://www.ru.nl/microbiology/). 

I love creating, managing, exploring and visualising large biological datasets, and I am a big believer in europe and european (science) collaboration.

I can also be found @ linkedin and @ 

## Current projects

### Genome architecture of Prokaryotes

Total number of genes and the related concepts coding density and gene density are commonly used to describe a prokaryotic genome, but the underlying genomic architecture that belies a dense or sparsely coded genome is not often discussed past the point of establishing that a genome is or isn’t dense. I have set out to show different strategies in becoming dense in a dataset spanning across all prokaryotyes.
